# Pipeline Analytics - Key Decisions

## Core Metrics Implemented

### Territory Management

- Deals per territory with total value/count
- Sales rep assignment tracking
- Territory progress by stage
- Target vs actual achievement

### Geographic Intelligence

- **City-level insights**: Total deals, total value, average deal value per city
- Origin-destination deal flow analysis
- Geographic hotspots and regional trends

These seemed to be the bare minimum a revenue operations manager would need to know about a territory and sales reps to understand what is happening on a day-to-day basis
